# Doctors Portal
###### _A Medical Website_
### Description

This is a demo website. It was created for a medical team, which is dedicated to the care of patients. Patients can easily book an appointment and the doctors in charge can see the booked appointment. The sign-in login system has been simplified here and the setting option is checked where the user can update the profile.
